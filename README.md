## Purpose and Inspiration

I once used this dataset in my machine learning course in undergraduate, so I decide to use it to do somthing that I find interesting, instead of only using it as a painful event.

## Short Description

The code reads the iris.json from www.kaggle.com (which is a json-reorganized version of the original one), and use petal values to determine the location of a flower, while using sepal values to determien the size of a flower.
